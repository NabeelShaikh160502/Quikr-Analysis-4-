## Bengaluru House Price Prediction –  Details
### Your project focuses on predicting house prices in Bengaluru using AI/ML. Here’s a detailed step-by-step breakdown:

### 1. Business Understanding
The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts house prices based on real estate data.
Factors affecting prices: Location, BHK, square footage, amenities, builder reputation, nearby infrastructure (metro, schools, hospitals), and market trends.
Use cases:
Helping buyers find fair prices.
Assisting real estate investors in decision-making.
Providing insights into market trends.

### 2. Data Collection
Sources of Data
Public Datasets: Kaggle, OpenStreetMap, Indian government portals.
Web Scraping: MagicBricks, 99acres, NoBroker, Housing.com.
APIs: Google Maps (for geospatial data), real estate APIs.
Data Features
Feature	Description
Location	Area in Bengaluru (Koramangala, Whitefield, etc.)
BHK	Number of bedrooms
Size (sq. ft.)	Total area in square feet
Price (Target Variable)	House price in INR
Price per sq. ft.	Derived feature: Price/Size
Bathrooms	Number of bathrooms
Availability	Ready to move / Under Construction
Floor	Floor number (if apartment)
Total Floors	Number of floors in the building
Amenities	Parking, gym, swimming pool, etc.
Distance to Metro, Schools, Hospitals	Important for pricing

### 3. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data

Fill missing values using median/mode.
Remove rows with too many missing values.
Cleaning Inconsistent Data

Convert BHK, Bathrooms, and Floors into numerical values.
Standardize location names (e.g., "HSR Layout" vs. "HSR Lyt").
Removing Outliers

Houses with extremely low or high price per square foot.
Unusual BHK values (e.g., 10 BHK in a small apartment).
Feature Engineering

Price per Sq. Ft. → Helps in removing inconsistent data.
Location Clustering → Grouping similar areas (K-means).
Distance-based Features → Distance to metro stations, malls, IT hubs.

### 4. Model Building
1. Regression Models (Baseline)
✅ Linear Regression → Simple, interpretable, works for small datasets.
✅ Decision Trees & Random Forest → Handles non-linearity, better accuracy.
✅ XGBoost & LightGBM → Best for structured tabular data.

2. Deep Learning Models
✅ Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) → Used if dataset is large.
✅ LSTM (for time-series trends) → If we include time-dependent data.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid Search, Randomized Search
Feature Selection (Recursive Feature Elimination)
5. Model Evaluation
✅ Metrics Used:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) → Measures prediction error.
R² Score → Measures how well the model explains variance.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) → Measures absolute error.
✅ Cross-Validation

K-Fold CV (e.g., 5-fold cross-validation)
✅ Comparison with Baseline Models

Benchmark against a simple model (mean price).
